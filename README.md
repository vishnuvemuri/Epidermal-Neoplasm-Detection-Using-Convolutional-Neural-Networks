# Epidermal-Neoplasm-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

Overview

This project aims to detect epidermal neoplasms (skin tumors) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, this project provides a framework for training, evaluating, and deploying CNN models to accurately classify skin lesions from medical images. The ultimate goal is to aid in early diagnosis and treatment planning for skin cancer.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning and augmenting image data.
Model Architecture: Implementation of state-of-the-art CNN architectures such as ResNet, VGG, and Inception.
Training and Validation: Comprehensive training pipeline with options for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
Evaluation Metrics: Detailed metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Model Deployment: Tools for deploying the trained model as a web service for real-time predictions.
Visualization Tools: Utilities for visualizing training progress, model performance, and example predictions.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Steps
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/epidermal-neoplasm-detection.git
cd epidermal-neoplasm-detection
Create a Virtual Environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation
Download Dataset: Obtain a dataset of skin lesion images, such as the ISIC archive.
Organize Data: Ensure the data is organized into appropriate directories (e.g., data/train, data/val).
Preprocess Data:
sh
Copy code
python preprocess.py --input_dir data/raw --output_dir data/processed
Model Training
Configure Training Settings: Modify the configuration file (configs/train_config.json) to set parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

Train the Model:

sh
Copy code
python train.py --config configs/train_config.json
Monitor Training: Use TensorBoard to visualize training progress.

sh
Copy code
tensorboard --logdir logs/
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the Model:

sh
Copy code
python evaluate.py --model_dir models/ --data_dir data/processed/val
Visualize Results: Use provided scripts to generate performance reports and confusion matrices.

sh
Copy code
python visualize.py --results_dir results/
Model Deployment
Export the Model:

sh
Copy code
python export_model.py --model_dir models/ --output_dir export/
Deploy as Web Service: Use Flask or a similar framework to deploy the model.

sh
Copy code
python app.py
